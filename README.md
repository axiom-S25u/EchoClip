EchoClip
background recorder for gd.

records your last 5 attempts and mixes in your mic. unlike other garbage mods it pipes straight to disk so your ram doesn't die.

stuff it does
720p 30fps (nvenc/hardware)

game audio + mic mix

uses a marker deque for attempts so it's actually accurate

15 min buffer (27k frames)

how
install FFmpeg API and Custom Keybinds. set a hotkey in the settings. hit the button to save.

why
because i'm tired of laggy recorders. suffering has begun.
please report all bugs in the github.
